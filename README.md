# 🌐 LangGraph-Features-Project

Welcome to the **LangGraph-Features-Project**!  
This project explores the power of [LangGraph](https://docs.langgraph.dev/) — a framework for building **stateful, graph-based, multi-agent applications** powered by LLMs.

LangGraph extends [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) by allowing developers to define **flexible control flow** using graphs, enabling advanced use cases like memory-driven workflows, branching logic, and agent collaboration.

## 🚀 Key Features of LangGraph

### 🔁 1. Graph-Based Workflow
- Define custom **nodes** and **edges** between them.
- Supports **loops**, **conditional branches**, and **parallel flows**.
- Great for **orchestrating complex language model pipelines**.

### 🤖 2. Multi-Agent Capabilities
- Design agents that **collaborate**, **delegate**, or **debate**.
- Each agent can have its own tools, memory, and instructions.
- Use-case: Developer agent + QA agent + Manager agent working together.

### 💾 3. Stateful Execution
- Keeps track of **context** and **intermediate states**.
- Lets your application **"remember"** across steps.
- Enables more dynamic and intelligent LLM behaviors.

### 🧩 4. Seamless LangChain Integration
- Reuses your existing LangChain components (chains, tools, memory, etc).
- Makes your LangChain apps more **modular and controllable**.

### 🐞 5. Debug-Friendly
- Clear graph structure = easier to debug and test.
- See how data flows from one node to another.
